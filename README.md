Real-time data has become a dominant aspect for understanding past, present, and future situations. Machine Learning (ML) is one such subject that uses a variety of algorithms to understand the correlation between the given data, visualize the current scenario, and predict the future forecast which is the most crucial part. The entire world is currently undergoing a devastating situation due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus known as COVID-19. The COVID-19 at present has proved that it is a potential threat to human life. To contribute to control the spread and rising number of active cases in India, this study demonstrates the future forecasting of the total number of active cases in India in the upcoming 15 days. The future forecast is predicted using the ARIMA Model (Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average) with the combination of Facebook Prophet which gives us the highest accuracy. The real-time data collection takes place from various resources after which the data pre-processing and data wrangling takes place. The data set is then split into the training set and testing set. Finally, the model is trained and tested for accuracy. With the completion of testing and training, the model is ready to predict future forecasts. The model also makes note of the predicted and actual values which helps it achieve higher accuracy in the future.
